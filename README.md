# Holy-Grail-Password-Safe
This program prompts the user questions from lines in the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The lines come from a specific scene where the knights of Camelot need to pass a bridge by answering questions. The answers may be found in the code or by looking up the official script from the movie(I have made a comment of the URL to where I took the lines from).
